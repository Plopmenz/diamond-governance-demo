# Diamond Governance Demo

I am not a frontend guy lol, this is a project based on a NFT mining template (https://github.com/BenBktech/NFT-MINTER).  
To get it up and running you need to run `npm i`, `npx hardhat compile` and `npm run start`.  
Do note however that the DAO on Mumbai requires you to be verified to be able to create proposals, so this will not work.  
It does give an idea of how the SDK works and what a sample project would look like and is usable if you deploy your own instance of Diamond Governance with a different membership structure.
